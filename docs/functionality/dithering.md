# Dithering

## Purpose

A finite palette cannot represent every input color. Dithering controls how
the resulting quantization error is distributed across pixels or animation
frames. It operates while a completed palette is applied:

```text
pixels + palette -> dither adjustment -> palette lookup -> indexed pixels
```

It answers **how should representation error be shaped**. It does not build the
palette, and it does not define the data structure used to search that palette.

## CLI surface

`img2sixel` selects a method with:

```text
-d METHOD
--diffusion=METHOD
```

The option retains the historical name `diffusion`, although some available
methods are ordered or positionally stable dithers rather than error-diffusion
kernels. The current base methods are:

- `auto` selects the normal automatic method;
- `none` maps the original pixel without diffusing error;
- `fs`, `atkinson`, `jajuni`, `stucki`, `burkes`, `sierra`, and `lso2` diffuse
  error to later pixels;
- `a_dither`, `x_dither`, and `bluenoise` use positionally stable
  perturbations;
- `interframe` and `stbn` provide animation-aware temporal behavior.

Methods have suboptions for concerns such as scan order, kernel variants,
strength, temporal sources, and scene changes. Use `img2sixel -H` or the
[`img2sixel(1)` manual](../../converters/img2sixel.1) as the detailed option
reference.

## Interaction with lookup

The dither method calls the selected lookup policy to turn its current color
candidate into a palette index. For error diffusion, the difference between
that candidate and the selected palette entry is propagated according to the
kernel. Ordered methods derive a perturbation from position instead.

The two `none` values have different meanings:

- `-d none` means no error propagation or ordered perturbation; lookup still
  chooses a palette entry;
- `--lookup-policy=none` means direct palette scanning; the selected dither
  method still runs.

Changing the lookup backend can change performance and, for policies that
discretize the query space, may change the selected entry. That can also alter
the error fed back by an error-diffusion method. Evaluate combinations rather
than assuming the options are performance-isolated.

## Scan order and parallelism

Error diffusion is order-dependent because one pixel changes the input seen by
later pixels. Raster and serpentine scans therefore have distinct output
contracts. Parallel bands need enough context to reproduce the intended error
state at their boundaries; merely assigning rows to workers is not equivalent
to sequential diffusion.

Positionally stable methods are easier to split because their adjustment is
derived from coordinates instead of mutable neighboring error. Temporal
methods add frame history and reset rules, so frame boundaries become part of
their reproducibility contract.

## Quality and tests

Byte-for-byte output is appropriate when deterministic algorithm behavior is
the contract. Perceptual metrics are appropriate when implementations may vary
but image quality must not regress. Inspect flat regions, gradients, edges,
alpha boundaries, and animation stability separately because an aggregate
score can hide structured artifacts.

Keep fixtures small for routine tests and use larger images only when the
quality characteristic needs spatial context. Follow the
[Testing Guide](../testing/guide.md) and
[Quality Measurement Policy](../quality/measurement-policy.md) for thresholds
and shell TAP conventions.

## Implementation and tests

Policy selection and application are coordinated in
[`dither.c`](../../src/dither.c). Dispatch is in
[`dither-policy.c`](../../src/dither-policy.c), with implementations in the
`src/dither-policy-*.c` files and shared behavior in
[`dither-common-pipeline.c`](../../src/dither-common-pipeline.c). Focused tests
are under [`tests/quant/palette/usage/`](../../tests/quant/palette/usage/).

[Lookup Policy](lookup-policy.md).
