# Model assets bundled with libsixel

This directory collects the neural network artifacts that power the perceptual
quality evaluator shipped with libsixel.  The layout mirrors the installation
structure so that the runtime helper can discover the data without additional
configuration.

```
models/
└── lpips/
    ├── lpips_diff.onnx      # decoder head that reduces feature maps
    └── lpips_feat.onnx      # feature extractor lifted from AlexNet-style CNNs
```

Both ONNX graphs originate from the `deepghs/imgutils` repository and are
redistributed under the upstream MIT License (see LICENSE). The helper binary
searches for the same relative structure under `share/libsixel/models/lpips`
after installation, which keeps development and deployment hierarchies
consistent.

The LPIPS workflow embeds a pair of images into a feature space and then runs a
compact head that approximates human perceptual distance.  The `lpips`
utility orchestrates this pipeline through ONNX Runtime, and it requires both
graphs to be present.  When ONNX Runtime support is enabled at build time the
installation step copies these models into the location described above.

Please consult the main `LICENSE` file for the exact upstream license text.
